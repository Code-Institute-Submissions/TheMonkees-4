## Abstract

This website is created for The Monkees band. They are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971.
The main purpose of the website was to stay in touch with their fans. The Monkees want to present their creations such as music,
videos and photos. Also, the band would like to publicise their availability to perform on fans requested events (weedings, 
christmas parties, etc.). The last purpose pointed by the Monkees was to share social media links of Youtube, Twitter and Facebook.

## Proposal

I had to use technologies I learnt so far, which are HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 
I have used The Resume Project (The Mini Project) by Code Institute as the example of the methodology of work.

I decided to create a website with the minimalistic design, as it is the easiest way to achieve proper result, with limited skills.

I have pointed out all main requirments and decided to create a navbar cointaining 4 buttons using Bootstrap Grid System to
provide desired responsive design. So for the medium and large devices we will get 4 buttons in the row and for the smaller displays
there will be 2 rows of 2 buttons. The buttons are News, Media, Photos and Book Us - so all main requirments will be provided in 
the form of responsive Navigation Bar.
The logo should always stay on the top of the page and lead us back to the homepage.
Footer also uses Bootstrap to display content in 1 or 3 rows.

### News

I also choose Bootstrap Grid System to present the section content in a responsive way. This time with sorting content in 1 or 2
columns, depending on the screen size.


To bring some life and to attract user's attention I have used Hover.css and Font Awesome that were introtuced to me in The Resume Project.
